## Introduction
```
These are just a few machine learning things
I feel will always be useful to me
```

### ClassifyMe.py
```
Is the IMAGE CLASSIFICATION script
it can be modified to suit your needs
```


### IoT_Camera.py

```
Is the OBJECT DETECTION script
it can be modified to suit your needs
```

```
Builds and trains the model with a CNN
```


### Quickly_Build_Dataset.py

```
Builds a dataset of images using BING API
You must put in your own key
```

### justinsdeeplearning and CNNs
